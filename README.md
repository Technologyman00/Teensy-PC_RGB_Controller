# Teensy-PC_RGB_Controller
 
The whole Idea behind this project was to create a much better RGB controller than the controllers I currently have or many of the MB softwares I have seen. Currently It has already met that goal as it can play any pattern for many many LEDs and up to 40 devices. I am still working on the user interface and many quality of life things, but the main functionality does work. HOWEVER, it will need a PCB made inorder to power all the LEDs as a Teensy cannot power that many safely.
